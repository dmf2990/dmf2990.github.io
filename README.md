## Portfolio Start - first dive into HTML and CSS (grid and flexbox)

This portfolio page was an introductory exploration into HTML structure, CSS (grid and flexbox), and Media queries. The task given was to upload mock paragraphs and placeholder projects/pictures, and learn how to correctly structure HTML files.

In the near future, I will populate relevent content, fix a few bugs, and implment flipping text modal boxes!


## Dependencies used
  -Github webpages

### What I really like?
This was an awesome time! Learning to structure HTML files was very interesting, and CSS is fun. I hope to continue building on this in the near future once we finish some more in depth React projects!!
