<h1>Drew Michael Franklin</h1>
<h2>Junior Software Developer</h2>
<h3> "The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything--the better you are with your loved ones, the better you are with enemies, the better you are at your job, the better you are with yourself."</h3>
<span>-Bill Murray</span>

<h3>Here's the Scoop:</h3>
	<p>I absolutely love technology and I have a strong interest in all of the STEM subjects.  In my free time I enjoy coding, fitness, traveling, fishing, and spending quality time with family.</p>
	<p>As a full stack junior software developer, I have an analytical mind set geared towards solving complex technical problems. My prior military service has also allowed me to understand the strength in combining a strong work ethic with team work, punctuality, and attention to detail.</p>

<h3>Professional Skillset</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Completeion of full-stack software development coding boot camp, in which crucial elements of JUnit test-driven development were implemented to drive the completion of projects to a comprehensive finish</li>
	<li>Worked in a team collaborative environment, as well as on an individual basis to plan, design, and develop full stack applications.</li> 
	<li>All applications utilize object-oriented programming, and were developed using Java, JavaScript, and Spring Framework along with GitBash source control</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technology Stack</h4>

<p>Java • Spring Framework • Hibernate • JPA • JavaScript • MVC • HTML5 • CSS3 • Flexbox • Grid • TDD • Agile • OOP • AJAX • JSON • Restful APIs • Responsive Design / Mobile • SQL • Relational Databases • Source Control / GitBash</p>
<h4>Military Service</h4>
<p>From an early age, I knew that I wanted to serve my country, and when that opportunity presented itself, I knew I wanted to go above and beyond. Out of 400 applicants, I was one of 12 selected to start the medic training program to become a Civil Affairs operator. This path was long, extremely difficult, and filled with complex issues that needed to be resolved with strict deadlines. After a full year of medical training, I graduated with honors, and joined my first 4 man team in January of 2013. On this team, I learned the necessity of team work as well as the importance of strong attention to detail, and built friendships that will last a lifetime.</p>
