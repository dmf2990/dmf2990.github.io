This portfolio page was an introductory exploration into HTML and CSS (grid and flexbox). 
Even though there are a lot of mock paragraphs and placeholder projects/pictures, the primary focus was to learn HTML and CSS (flexbox and Grid).
Thus, I have focused on styling and structure of HTML here, however I hope to populate this content as soon as class is done at the end of April.
